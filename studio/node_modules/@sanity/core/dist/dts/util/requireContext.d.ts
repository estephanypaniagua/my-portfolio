/**
 * This file exposes a "register" function which hacks in a `require.context`function,
 * mirroring webpacks version (https://webpack.js.org/guides/dependency-management/#requirecontext)
 *
 * Basically allows you to do `require.context('./types', true, /\.js$/)` to import multiple
 * files at the same time. While generally not advised (given it's a webpack-only thing),
 * people are already using it in the wild, so it breaks when trying to deploy GraphQL APIs,
 * or when running scripts using `sanity exec`.
 *
 * We have to inject the `require.context` function to each required file, which is done by
 * overriding injecting a small script that runs before the start of each file.
